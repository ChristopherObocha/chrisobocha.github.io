        <h2>My name is Chris and I'm in love with nature</h2>

        <p><strong>I am recent graduate of Computer Science</strong>, from the prestigious Babcock University. I was born and I live in one of the poorer areas of Lagos, however, I am blessed to have attended one of the most expensive universities in Nigeria and this duality exposed me to one of the most unique experiences in my life and it is a major proponent in my ambitions to connect people of different backgrounds and to improve life for all through tech.   
        </p>

        <h3>My Drive</h3>
        <p>Traversing through the dualities of rich and poor, I developed a strong interest in wealth gaps and how it affects or its effects on cultural and economic differences. Moved by my experiences, I constantly try to infuse my love for differing fields like history, geography, media to my love for tech. I decided to major in Computer Science as my first degree because I believe in foundational knowledge and I believe that tech is the future and positively harnessing its capabilities can greatly benefit humanity. </p>

        <h3>My goals</h3>

        <p>I propose the following objectives. First, I want to gain firm knowledge of applying  the engineering principles to software development. Secondly, I want to learn processes, methodologies, tools which will allow me to deliver tech in impactful ways to society. Finally, I want to obtain the practical ability to manage projects and communication skills to build strong relationships with clients and the world in general.  
        </p>

        <p>To achieve my goals, it is imperative that I acquire a profound knowledge of innovation and management while developing both professional and research skills.</p>
